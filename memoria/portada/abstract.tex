The problem addressed is framed within the field of robotics and computer vision. These are two currently growing fields that offer effective solutions in many fields of application, such as autonomous driving, where a vehicle could be driven without a driver onboard. In this way, long journeys such as those made in the transport of goods, would be safer and faster.\\

The main goal of this project is to develop a self-driving car on a low-cost and small-size platform capable of driving on a circuit or road in a dynamic environment, interacting with common city objects. The proposed objective has been developed in two different environments; in a simulated environment, where various experiments are carried out in order to check the viability of the proposed solution to then reproduce the same scenario in a real environment, implementing the solution on a real robot.\\

The goal set has been solved through the use of two neural networks: one for road following, which is combined with a controller that uses the output of said network to send proper linear and angular velocity to the robot, and another neural network which aims to detect the objects present in the environment and react accordingly to them.\\

As it is a low-cost platform, limitations of the power offered by the board that integrates the robot have been found. Despite these difficulties, it has been possible to solve the proposed problem, mainly by reducing the resolution of the image received by the neural networks and optimizing the operating system. In addition, other areas of application have been proposed in which the developed software could be useful.\\
