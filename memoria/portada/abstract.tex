The tackled problem belongs to robotics and computer vision fields. These, nowadays are becoming too popular because of the potential they have and the large usages where can be applied, like for example, autonomous driving where a vehicle could be driven without a driver onboard. In this way, long route transportation would be safer and faster.\\

The main goal of this project is to develop a self-driving car within a platform with low cost and limited size, that must be able to drive around a circuit or road with common city objects that it must deal with. The goal has been splitted into two different environments; a simulated environment, where some experiments have been done in order to test the solution provided, and a real environment, similar to the simulated one but with real robot and objects.\\

The goal set has been solved with two neural networks, one used for road following combined with a controller that used the network output in order to send proper linear and angular speed to the robot, and other network to detect the environment objects and react correctly.\\

Some limitations where found because of the low cost platform selected, mainly coming from the robot's board power. This issue was solved by decreasing the image resolution that the neural networks work with and doing some optimization in the operative system. In addition, some applications has been suggested to integrate the software developed in other fields.\\
